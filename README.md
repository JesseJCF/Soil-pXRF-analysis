This repository contains data, a study map, and code used to evaluate pXRF data of plant tissue collected from Manresa Island (a fly ash disposal site and decommissioned power plant) and a control site located 1.3 miles southwest of the island.  

# Abstract/Intro
Decommissioned power plants have the potential to either degrade local environments and social conditions through neglectful management, or uplift local conditions through responsible adaptive reuse. Manresa Island is an illuminating case study on possible adaptive reuse management strategies. While once an active powerplant and fly ash waste disposal site, the island’s powerplant has been decommissioned, and successional species have colonised the largely anthropogenic soil. The northern portion of the island has grown into a forest composed of species such as birch, cedar, juniper, and tree of heaven. Wetlands on the western portion of the island have a significant population of phragmites grass. The island ecosystems also support year-round populations of species such as deer, turkeys, and coyotes, as well as migratory birds.

As Manresa Island is adapted to become a public recreation site, it is crucial to respond to the island’s current ecologies and take into account states of soil and vegetation. Fly ash produced by coal- and oil-burning power plants can contain elevated levels of toxic material. Therefore–in coordination with research groups investigating soil and tree woody tissue–we used pXRF analysis to evaluate heavy metal accumulation in plant tissue, with implications for phytoremediation techniques and exposure risk analysis. We found significantly elevated levels of Ba, Se, Zn, Ni, Sr, and V within the leaves of white birch (Betula papyrifera) trees on Manresa Island. This reflected soil contents but contrasted tree core measurements, demonstrating variable nutrient and contaminant distribution within birch tree bodies. Additionally, we tested the stems of Phragmites australis, a fast-growing, invasive species located throughout both Manresa Island and the control site. Phragmites stems contained elevated levels of Cl and Br. By clarifying how contaminants move through Manresa’s vegetation, this study offers guidance for designing adaptive reuse plans that prioritize both environmental health and community safety.
